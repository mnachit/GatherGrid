# Java Web Application with Tomcat, JPA, Maven, JSP, and Servlets

## Introduction
This is a Java web application project that utilizes several key technologies for web development. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- **Java:** This project is written in Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language.

- **Tomcat 10:** Apache Tomcat is a popular open-source servlet container and web server. It is used to run Java web applications, including servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages).

- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** JPA is a Java specification that provides a standard way to interact with relational databases. It simplifies database access and management by providing an object-oriented approach to data persistence.

- **Maven (mvn):** Apache Maven is a build automation and project management tool. It helps manage dependencies, build projects, and streamline the development process. This project uses Maven for building and managing project dependencies.

- **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** JSP is a technology that allows you to create dynamic web pages with Java. It enables embedding Java code within HTML pages, making it easier to generate dynamic content.

- **Servlets:** Servlets are Java-based components that extend the functionality of a web server. They handle requests and responses, making it possible to build dynamic web applications.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `src/main/java`: Contains Java source code, including servlets, JPA entities, and other Java classes.

- `src/main/webapp`: This directory holds your web application resources, including JSP files, HTML files, CSS, and other web-related assets.

- `pom.xml`: The Maven Project Object Model file. It defines project dependencies, plugins, and build configurations.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Apache Tomcat 10 installed. You can download it from the official website: [Tomcat 10 Download](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi).

3. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans).

4. Configure your database settings in the `persistence.xml` file if you're using JPA.

5. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`.

6. Deploy the project to your Tomcat server.

7. Access the web application in your web browser.

## Usage
Customize and build upon this project to create your own Java web application. You can add new servlets, JSP pages, and JPA entities to meet your specific requirements.

Happy coding!
